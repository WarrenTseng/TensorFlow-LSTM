# Tensorflow-LSTM


## Description   
This is my practice to understand LSTM and usage of tensorflow. 

The repo use LSTM cell to train Jin-Yong novel, which is written by famous Chinese novelist. I choose character-level language as model and generate a short paragraph to see if it works well or not.  


## Data
  
## How to use  


## Configuration  



## Experiment Result  

## Reference  
I reference a lot of document to implement this code. Here are some of documents that is highly recommended if you are interested in RNN
